## Description

This project analyzes inflation data and sentiment analysis from Google News to understand the relationship between news sentiment and inflation rates in Canada. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model building, and visualization using Python libraries such as pandas, sci-kit-learn, NLTK, spaCy, and matplotlib.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting data types, sorting, and filtering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing trends, correlations, and distributions.
- Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features for modelling using pipelines and feature selection techniques.
- Model Building: Implementing machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc.
- Visualization: Creating visualizations such as ROC curves, confusion matrices, word clouds, etc.

## Models

The project uses various machine learning models for analysis, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc. These models are evaluated based on performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, and ROC-AUC score.

## Visualization

The project includes visualizations generated using libraries like Matplotlib, seaborn, and Word Cloud to represent data trends, model performance, and word frequency analysis.
